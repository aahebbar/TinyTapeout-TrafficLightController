## How it works

Implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) that governs the traffic light in a 4 way intersection

## How to test

Used in a 4-way road intersection and used to control the traffic flow 

## External hardware

Clock can be generated through an extrnal oscillator and reset can be asserted or deasserted through a slide switch. The outputs can drive a set of 8 LEDs where 2 LEDs will represent the colour of the traffic light
